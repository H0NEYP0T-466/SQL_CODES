## üìè Code Style Guidelines

### SQL Code Standards

#### Naming Conventions
```sql
-- Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores
CREATE TABLE patient_records (
    patient_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    date_of_birth DATE
);

-- Use consistent prefixes for related objects
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_GetPatientInfo
CREATE FUNCTION fn_CalculateAge
CREATE VIEW vw_ActivePatients
```

#### Formatting Guidelines
```sql
-- Use uppercase for SQL keywords
SELECT p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name
FROM patients p
JOIN appointments a ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
WHERE a.appointment_date >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY p.last_name, p.first_name;

-- Indent subqueries and complex statements
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE patient_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT patient_id
    FROM appointments
    WHERE appointment_date > GETDATE()
);
```

#### Comments and Documentation
```sql
-- Single-line comments for brief explanations
/* 
   Multi-line comments for detailed explanations
   of complex logic or business rules
*/

-- Header comment for each script
/*
===============================================
Script Name: patient_management.sql
Purpose: Demonstrates patient record management
Author: Your Name
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Database: SQL Server 2019+
===============================================
*/
```
